# Generative Adversarial Networks with Pytorch
In this repository, you'll learn about GAN.
A generative adversarial network is a class of machine learning frameworks designed by Ian Goodfellow and his colleagues in June 2014. 

Two neural networks contest with each other in a game. Given a training set, this technique learns to generate new data with the same statistics as the training set.
